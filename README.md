# 25_day_project_replication
In this particular challenge, I would replicate the projects of others in GitHub to learn how to build projects and improve my skills.
The projects would preferably include Python projects. However, appearances would be made by MATLAB projects as well. The idea is to replicate projects made by others.
WHY 25? Because I have midsem exams after that.
Main focus  --> Data analytics projects
            --> NLP/DL project replication
            --> Python building an application, maybe?
            --> Signal Processing projects
Aim --> to become better at coding and be more confident on building projects
    --> Instill habit of reading other people's codes


Okay so I've found a GFG link for projects I am going to follow the projects and would implement them each day here:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-projects-beginner-to-advanced/
Here is the LINK

now the idea for learning is: 
                        A) for initial some projects : read the code and then replicate the code on own.
                        B) Over time start writing on own.
