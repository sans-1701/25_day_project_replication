# 25_day_project_replication
In this particular challenge, I would replicate the projects of others in GitHub to learn how to build projects and improve my skills.
The projects would preferably include Python projects. However, appearances would be made by MATLAB projects as well. The idea is to replicate projects made by others.
WHY 25? Because I have midsem exams after that.
Main focus  --> Data analytics projects
            --> NLP/DL project replication
            --> Python building an application, maybe?
            --> Signal Processing projects
Aim --> to become better at coding and be more confident on building projects
    --> Instill habit of reading other people's codes
